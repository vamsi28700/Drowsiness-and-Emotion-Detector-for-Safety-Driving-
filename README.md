# Drowsiness and Emotion Detector for Safety Driving
This project is made to detect if a driver is feeling drowsy and what type of emotions he is reflecting at that particular time.
A low-cost real-time driver’s drowsiness detection system is developed with emotions also been measured. In the proposed system, a webcam records the video and the driver’s face are detected in each frame employing image processing techniques. Facial landmarks on the detected face are pointed and subsequently the eye aspect ratio, mouth-opening ratio, and nose-length ratio are computed and depending on their values, drowsiness is detected based on thresholding.
